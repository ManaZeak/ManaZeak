"\">ESIEA Paris</a> created by four random music lovers ; Arthur Beaulieu, "
"Pierre Bouniol, Pierre-Balthazar Donadieu de Lavit and Valentin Peiro. The "

"The academic project succesfully ended in February 2018 but Arthur Beaulieu "
"and Pierre Bouniol decided to keep the developement on track ever since to "
"reach this ambition. On this journey to musical smoothiness, Armand Vignat "
"brought his sharp skills in system administration to enhance the app "
"deployement. Raphaël Beekman helped a lot for UI specifications and will for "
"sure help again. Erwan Le Guern did not wrote any line yet, but gave so much "
"of his time helping on defining what ManaZeak is. Finally, Laetitia Genin "
"made the text logo of ManaZeak."
